We've been working hard to make GitLocalize better. Check out the cool features that we've added recently.

### 🔍Filters


Translating updates just got easier. You can now select to display only untranslated strings or only machine translated strings, which is especially important if you’re working with large markdown or json files. Just click on the filter icon in the top right part of the editor

and select the desired view:

### 🏷The GitLocalized Badge


If you want your community to see the translation progress of your project, feel free to add our ![GitLocalized](/img/badge.svg) badge to your Readme file, Wiki or Contributing Guidelines.

To generate the badge link, head to the Badge tab in Project Overview:
![GitLocalized Badge](/img/badge_1.png)

You can also generate badges for each of the project languages:

![de](/img/badge_de.svg)
![fr](/img/badge_fr.svg)
![ptbr](/img/badge_ptbr.svg)


Check out how other projects are using our badges:

### 🗞Group multiple files in a single pull request

If you're a language moderator or project owner, you may now find it easier to send multiple translated files (review requests) in a single pull request
