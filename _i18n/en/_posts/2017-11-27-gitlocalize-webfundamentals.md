![Web Fundamentals x GitLocalize](/img/webfundamentals_gitlocalize.png)

We are excited to announce that [Google is now experimenting with GitLocalize](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/translations)! We’re assisting the Web Fundamentals community with localizing their website. 

So far, the Web Fundamentals community has been able to localize the site into 17 languages. But keeping the translations up-to-date has proven to be more than challenging. We believe that GitLocalize is the perfect solution to this problem!

Join the Web Fundamentals community to localize their vast knowledge of cutting-edge web technology into your language today. Innovation should never get lost in translation.
